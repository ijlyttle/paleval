# paleval

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of paleval is to help you evaluate the effectiveness of color
palettes and color maps. For the purpose of this package, we define:

  - `palette` an ordered collection of colors intended for use with
    categorical data. Order is used for familiarity, rather than to
    imply order among observations of the encoded variable.

  - `map` an ordered collection of colors intended for use with
    numerical data, or for data where we wish to imply order among
    observations of the encoded variable.

## Installation
