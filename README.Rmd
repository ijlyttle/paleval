# paleval

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of paleval is to help you evaluate the effectiveness of color palettes and color maps. For the purpose of this package, we define:

- `palette` an ordered collection of colors intended for use with categorical data. Order is used for familiarity, rather than to imply order among observations of the encoded variable.

- `map` an ordered collection of colors intended for use with numerical data, or for data where we wish to imply order among observations of the encoded variable.

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of paleval from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("paleval")
```
-->

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library("paleval")
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
