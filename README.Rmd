The goal of paleval is to help you evaluate the effectiveness of color palettes and color maps. It builds from the [colorspace](http://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org) package, used to design color maps, and the [farver](https://github.com/thomasp85/farver) package, used to evaluate the perceptual difference between two colors.

For the purpose of this package, we define:

- **palette**: a collection of colors intended for use with categorical data. Order is used for familiarity, rather than to imply order among observations of the encoded variable. Interpolation within a palette is not required to be a well-formed idea.

- **map**: an ordered collection of colors intended for use with numerical data, or for data where we wish to imply order among observations of the encoded variable. We expect to be able to interpolate within a map.
